The thing you're using to talk to me is a computer. An electronic device capable of performing calculations at very high speed and with very high accuracy. A device which maps one set of numbers onto another set of numbers.,['computer']
546,What is a super computer?," Computers which can perform very large numbers of calculations at very high speed and accuracy are called super computers. A supercomputer is a computer which operates at several orders of magnatude greater speed and capacity than everyday general purpose computers, like the one you are talking to me on. You know, the big iron!",['super computer']
547,Who invented computers?," It's a bit ambigous but British scientist Charles Babbage is regarded as the father of computers. One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.",['invented computers']
548,What was the first computer," It's hard to say, but The ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946. You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.",['first computer']
549,What is a microprocessor?," An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer. A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer. The heart of the computer, to put it simply. The brain of a computer, to put it simply.

550,What is an operating system?," Software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the computer to run other software is called an operating system, or the OS.

554,How does a computer work?, Computers are very dumb.  They only execute instructions given by humans. Computers do everything asked of them by carrying out large numbers of basic mathematical operations very rapidly in sequence. Computers perform very large number of calculations to get the result.
